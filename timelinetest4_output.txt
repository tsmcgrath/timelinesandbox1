Explanation
Calculate Total Time Span: Calculate the total time span of the timeline.
Proportional Position: Calculate the proportional position of each event in the timeline.
Event Distance: Convert the proportional position to distance in feet.
Percentage of Total Time: Calculate the percentage of the total time span for each event.
Percentage of Total Distance: Calculate the percentage of the total distance for each event.
Ensure Final Event is 100%: Explicitly set the last event's distance and percentages to 100%.
This corrected algorithm ensures that the final event accurately reflects 100% of both time and distance, with other events proportionally placed along the timeline.
